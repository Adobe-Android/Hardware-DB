# MemDB-server
A part of MemDB, a web application to help you choose the right kit of RAM for your system.
The front-end portion can be found here https://github.com/Adobe-Android/MemDB

## Future Plans
This project will stick around, but future innovation will likely take place in another form. I plan to build a hardware API (to enable the kind of things I want moving forward) and the front-end for that will likely be a minimal example of its capabilities.

## Use
Build the beginnings of a system in the application to make sure you don't waste money on a RAM kit your CPU or Motherboard don't even support.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine

Install necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the server:

```
npm start
```

## API
I'm now using a modified version of a Node.js API to retrieve parts from PCPartPicker
