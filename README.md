# Hardware-DB

An open and extensive personal computer hardware API.

## Future Plans
This is the future of my old MemDB-server project. I'm building my own hardware database and with advanced specifications on all major computer parts. 

To give you a small sample, these are the specs I'd like to have just for the CPUs.
